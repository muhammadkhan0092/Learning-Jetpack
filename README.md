# 📱 Learning Jetpack Compose  

This repository contains my practice and learning journey with **Jetpack Compose**. It starts with basic UI components, progresses into an MVVM-based mini project, and then includes a **responsive shopping UI** that adapts smoothly across different screen sizes.

## ✨ Features  

### 🔹 Basic Components  
- Button  
- Text  
- Image  
- Layouts: `Box`, `Row`, `Column`, `BoxWithConstraints`  
- Experimentation with margins, paddings, and alignment  

### 🔹 Mini Project (MVVM Architecture)  
- Clean separation of **UI**, **ViewModel**, and **Data** layers  
- Uses `StateFlow`/`LiveData` for reactive UI updates  
- Demonstrates best practices in Jetpack Compose + MVVM  

### 🔹 Shopping UI (Responsive Design)  
- Completed screens: *[add which ones are done, e.g., Home, Product Detail, Cart]*  
- **Responsive layout** → Works across phones and tablets  
- **Scalable margins/paddings** → Values taken from `dimens.xml`  
- **Scalable text sizes** → Text scaling based on screen dimensions  
- UI built with `Box`, `Row`, `Column`, and constraint-based layouts  
- Material 3 components with custom styling
